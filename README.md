The projects scans for most of the possible combination of URL address starting with http:, www, .com in a text file which would be input to the parser. Program extracts the links, an saves them in HTML file making link click-able adding anchor tag.

example use: Suppose you have a text file containing 1000 links from your browsing bookmarks, typically when you have to browse them next time you may need to copy and paste the links to the address bar of the browser but once you convert the text file to HTML file you save a lot of time in the run.
